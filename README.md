Future on Economi about change from A
Technologies like ChatGPT are potentially quite disruptive to a lot of economic activity. This is really true for a lot of other AI
technology today. Whenever you have a new
capability where you can through technical means produce
something that was hard to do before
that was surprising. Obviously, ChatGPT has been
surprising to many people, not just lay people
but experts as well as to how good it is. Whenever you have such
a new capability, it can adjust the balance of many equations that are out there that determine
how people do what they do. In particular, for language generation
technologies like ChatGPT, generating coherent
on point prose is historically has always, for most of human history been very costly and
hard thing to do. If it suddenly becomes
much cheaper and easier to do by automated
means through AI, it might first
enable all kinds of new applications that were not cost-effective
to try before. That's really
exciting. It can also enable a lot of AI
decision-making that was possible before but limited in its applicability because of the need to communicate
results by language. I think that has been
something that has been a barrier to many AI
applications up to now. If all of a sudden AI is able to communicate fairly credibly, fairly fluidly with people, it's going to enable many applications that
we didn't see before. Now, how will that affect current economic
actors and the economy? Well, whenever you have new
opportunities, new changes, there's really two effects
you need to think about. One is substitution. If there's some other way
that something is being done that way maybe
pushed out by the new, cheaper, more
effective way perhaps. That could include some possible substitutions of things that people do now that will
be done more with AI. The other possibility
is compliments. When a technology can amplify the effectiveness or reduce the costs of a person doing something, they
can do it better, more efficiently
by the addition of AI that may lead to
more opportunities for those people to be more productive and to
produce better products. I think typically both of
those factors are in play. Technology like
language generation by AI have both substitute
effects and complement effects and the relative sway of those may vary depending on the context and it
may change over time. One example, I think to
illustrate how AI can be complimentary and
substitutable is through our experience
with the game of chess. Now chess is not an economically significant or
important activity but I think it's instructive
to think about that example. Twenty years ago, actually, maybe 25 years ago by now, an AI program defeated
the world chess champion. So no person was as good as
a computer could be a chess. Now, for a while, the best chess players
were actually teams of humans working with
chess programs. The combination can beat any person could be
any chess program. For about 20 years
that remain to be the case but the chess
programs got better and better and now with a
human and a chess program, the human is not really
bringing much to the table. We saw this pattern of
supremacy by the AI. The complement that
the teamwork between a human and an AI being
complimentary and their skills. But then eventually as
the technology changed, it was no longer complimentary. We may see such
patterns like that and a whole range of other AI
technologies over time.
